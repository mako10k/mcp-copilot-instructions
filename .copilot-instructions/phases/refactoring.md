# Refactoring Phase Instructions

## Refactoring Principles

1. **Write Tests First**: Ensure existing functionality won't break
2. **Small Steps**: Only one improvement at a time
3. **Commit Frequently**: Commit after each improvement
4. **Review**: Clarify the intent of changes

## Key Points

- Reduce code duplication (DRY principle)
- Split functions (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Improve naming (names that convey intent)
- Remove unnecessary code
