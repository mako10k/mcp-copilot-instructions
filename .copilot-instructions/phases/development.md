# Development Phase Instructions

## New Feature Development Flow

1. **Requirements Confirmation**: Clarify specifications of features to implement
2. **Design**: Design interfaces and data structures
3. **Implementation**: Proceed with TDD (Test-Driven Development)
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests

## Implementation Considerations

- Commit frequently with small commits
- Prioritize type safety
- Don't forget error handling
- Add documentation comments (JSDoc)
